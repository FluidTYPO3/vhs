Contribution
============

Unlike most TYPO3 documentation, this manual does not support the
popular *Edit on GitHub* workflow for manual contributions, as these
documentation files are automatically generated from the ViewHelper
source files - and overwritten on each generation run.

Therefore, contribute to this documentation by editing the appropriate source
files at

*  https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/vhs/tree/development/Classes/ViewHelpers

For example, adding a new core feature list item to the *asset* page at

*  https://docs.typo3.org/other/fluidtypo3/vhs/main/en-us/fluidtypo3/vhs/latest/Asset.html

is done by editing the class comment in

*  https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/vhs/blob/development/Classes/ViewHelpers/AssetViewHelper.php

To enrich the comment text you can use the common directives of the Markdown
markup language.
