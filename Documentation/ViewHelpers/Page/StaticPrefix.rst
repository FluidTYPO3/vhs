Page: Static Prefix
===================

Use this ViewHelper to read the contents of the `plugin.tx_vhs.settings.prependPath`
TypoScript location - this setting stores the static prefix which gets added to all
relative resource URIs generated by VHS; whenever you require a ViewHelper which
does not respect this setting you can use this ViewHelper to prepend that setting
after the value is returned from the other ViewHelper.

Arguments
=========


This ViewHelper has no arguments.
