/**
 * Once: Standard
 *
 * Displays nested content or "then" child once per rendering
 * stack - i.e. per Layout, or Template if no Layout is used.
 *
 * "Once"-style ViewHelpers are purposed to only display their
 * nested content once per XYZ, where the XYZ depends on the
 * specific type of ViewHelper (session, cookie etc).
 *
 * In addition the ViewHelper is a ConditionViewHelper, which
 * means you can utilize the f:then and f:else child nodes as
 * well as the "then" and "else" arguments.
