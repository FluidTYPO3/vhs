/**
 * URL text segment sanitizer. Sanitizes the content into a
 * valid URL segment value which is usable in an URL without
 * further processing. For example, the text "I am Mr. Brown,
 * how are you?" becomes "i-am-mr-brown-how-are-you".
 *
 * Also useful when creating anchor link names, for example
 * for news entries in your custom EXT:news list template, in
 * which case each news item's title would become an anchor:
 *
 * <a name="{newsItem.title -> v:format.url.sanitizeString()}"></a>
 *
 * And links would look much like the detail view links:
 *
 * /news/#this-is-a-newsitem-title
 *
 * When used with list views it has the added benefit of not
 * breaking if the item referenced is removed, it can be read
 * by Javascript (for example to dynamically expand the news
 * item being referenced). The sanitized urls are also ideal
 * to use for AJAX based detail views - and in almot all cases
 * the sanitized string will be 100% identical to the one used
 * by Realurl when translating using table lookups.
