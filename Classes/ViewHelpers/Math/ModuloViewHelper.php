/**
 * Math: Modulo
 * Perform modulo on $input. Returns the same type as $input,
 * i.e. if given an array, will transform each member and return
 * the result. Supports array and Iterator (in the following
 * descriptions "array" means both these types):
 *
 * If $a and $b are both arrays of the same size then modulo is
 * performed on $a using members of $b, by their index (so these
 * must match in both arrays).
 *
 * If $a is an array and $b is a number then modulo is performed
 * on $a using $b for each calculation.
 *
 * If $a and $b are both numbers simple modulo is performed.
