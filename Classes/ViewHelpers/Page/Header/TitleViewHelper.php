/**
 * ### ViewHelper used to override page title
 *
 * This ViewHelper uses the TYPO3 PageRenderer to set the
 * page title - with everything this implies regarding
 * support for TypoScript settings.
 *
 * Specifically you should note the setting `config.noPageTitle`
 * which must be set to either 1 (one) in case no other source
 * defines the page title (it's likely that at least one does),
 * or 2 (two) to indicate that the TS-controlled page title
 * must be disabled. A value of 2 (two) ensures that the title
 * used in this ViewHelper will be used in the rendered page.
 *
 * #### Why can I not forcibly override the title?
 *
 * This has been opted out with full intention. The reasoning
 * behind not allowing a Fluid template to forcibly override the
 * page title that may be set through TypoScript is that many
 * other extensions (mainly SEO-focused ones) will be setting
 * and manipulating the page title - and if overridden in a
 * template file using a ViewHelper, it would be almost impossible
 * to detect unless you already know exactly where to look.
 * Enforcing use of the core behavior is the only way to ensure
 * that this ViewHelper can coexist with other extensions in
 * a fully controllable way.
